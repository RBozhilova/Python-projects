'''

This script creates survey form.  
The questions are asked on by one.
After a question is asked the program should wait for user input in the console.
After answer is provided, the user is presented with the second question.
This goes until all the questions are exhausted.
After all questions are answered, the result should be saved into the Survey table.
Ð¢he csv file output should be created. The output file contains information from the database.
